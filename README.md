# Real Estate Simulation
Simulate the impact of real estate price, currency exchange rates and market development on the profitability of private real estate.

# Domain Background
Having a diverse portfolio of investments is a cornerstone in personal wealth managment. For many individuals, real estate constitutes a considerable part of their personal portfolio. While the real estate investment risks are not exactly the same as the stock, bond or foreign currency investment risks, the former tend to be related to the latter.

> Example: Living outside the US means that real estate is purchased using a different currency from the USD. The price of that currency can change and therefore influence the value of the real estate relative to the purchasing power of the US dollar.

This means that an informed personal portfolio strategy is influenced by the following factors:
* The expected market price of real estate;
* The expected currency exchange rates;
* The expected condition of the stock market;

The last point pertains to the proportion of capital invested in real estate and stocks.

In general, one should continuously evaluate the question: *'Given a certain amount of capital, what is the correct allocation percentage between the various available investment vehicles in the personal portfolio.'*
